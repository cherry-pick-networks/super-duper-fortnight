# Picker Frontend Rules

## Naming
- Prefer single-word base form; verbs for functions, singular nouns for data.
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted (e.g., auth, api, ui).
- Collections: use singular name + _list/_map (e.g., course_list).

## Style
- TypeScript-only, use explicit types for public APIs and props.
- English-only code, comments, docs, commits.
- Code comments must be written in English only.
- Keep files small and focused; one component per file.

## Conventions
- Follow Google JavaScript Style Guide for TypeScript/JS.
- Prefer No CSS Club principles for styling: keep CSS minimal, readable, and dependency-free.

## Architecture
- Fresh: keep routes thin; place UI logic in components or islands.
- Islands: only for interactivity; avoid unnecessary client JS.
- Shared UI goes in `components/`, interactive pieces in `islands/`.

## Data & API
- Centralize API calls in `lib/api/` and reuse typed clients.
- Validate and normalize external data at the boundary.
- Prefer `fetch` wrappers with typed response parsing.

## State & Effects
- Use `@preact/signals` for local UI state.
- Avoid global state unless required; document cross-route state.
- Handle async errors explicitly; surface user-friendly messages.

## WharfKit
- Load WharfKit only inside islands.
- Keep chain config in a single module (e.g., `lib/wharfkit/`).
- Never log or persist sensitive wallet data.

## CSS
- Use vanilla CSS only; do not use Tailwind or other utility CSS frameworks.

## Examples
```tsx
// ✅ GOOD
type CourseCardProps = { course_id: string };

// ❌ BAD
type CourseCardProps = { cid: string };
```
