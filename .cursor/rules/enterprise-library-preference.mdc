# Enterprise Library Preference

- If an enterprise-grade library already provides the required feature, use it.
- Avoid custom implementations when a mature library is available.
- Apply this rule to both backend and frontend work.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Security posture and vulnerability history are acceptable.
- Active maintenance (recent releases and issue response).
- Compatibility with existing stack and runtime constraints.
- Documentation quality and API stability.
- License allows commercial/enterprise usage.
